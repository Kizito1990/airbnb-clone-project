# airbnb-clone-project
Project Overview: Airbnb Clone
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack software development initiative designed to replicate the functionality and architecture of a real-world booking platform like Airbnb. The goal is to equip learners with hands-on experience in building scalable, secure, and collaborative web applications that follow industry best practices.

Through this project, participants will gain practical exposure to backend system architecture, relational database design, secure API development, and CI/CD deployment workflows. Additionally, the project emphasizes teamwork, version control, and documentation, preparing developers for real-world software engineering environments.
