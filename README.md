# airbnb-clone-project
Project Overview: Airbnb Clone
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack software development initiative designed to replicate the functionality and architecture of a real-world booking platform like Airbnb. The goal is to equip learners with hands-on experience in building scalable, secure, and collaborative web applications that follow industry best practices.

Through this project, participants will gain practical exposure to backend system architecture, relational database design, secure API development, and CI/CD deployment workflows. Additionally, the project emphasizes teamwork, version control, and documentation, preparing developers for real-world software engineering environments.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of the Airbnb Clone Project is to simulate the end-to-end development of a booking platform, enabling learners to:

Understand and apply modern backend design patterns

Implement secure, production-ready APIs

Collaborate effectively using GitHub

Design scalable databases and deploy applications using CI/CD pipelines

Integrate various technologies into a unified, efficient system

## Technology Stack
Backend Framework: Django (Python)

Database: MySQL

API Layer: GraphQL

Version Control & Collaboration: Git & GitHub

CI/CD: Docker, GitHub Actions (or similar platforms)

Documentation: Markdown

Security: API authentication & authorization best practices
